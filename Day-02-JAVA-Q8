# Answer

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String name = sc.next();
        int m1 = sc.nextInt();
        int m2 = sc.nextInt();
        int m3 = sc.nextInt();
        int m4 = sc.nextInt();
        int m5 = sc.nextInt();
        int total = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5;
        double average = total / 5.0;
        System.out.println("Name of the Student:" + name+"\n"+"Total marks:" + total+"\n"+"Average marks:" + average);
    }
}        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
