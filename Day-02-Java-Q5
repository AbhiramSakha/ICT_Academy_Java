# Answer

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String args[]) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        float num = sc.nextFloat();
        int sqrtNum = sc.nextInt();
        int base = sc.nextInt();
        int power = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n%d\n%d", (int)Math.floor(num), (int)Math.ceil(num), Math.round(num), (int)Math.sqrt(sqrtNum), (int)Math.pow(base, power));
    }
}
