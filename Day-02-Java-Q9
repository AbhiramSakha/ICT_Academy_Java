# Answer

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int side = sc.nextInt();
        int length = sc.nextInt();
        int breadth = sc.nextInt();
        int radius = sc.nextInt();
        int base = sc.nextInt();
        int height = sc.nextInt();
        int areaSquare = side * side;
        int areaRectangle = length * breadth;
        double areaCircle = Math.floor(Math.PI * radius * radius * 100) / 100.0;
        int areaTriangle = (base * height) / 2;
        System.out.printf("Area of Square=%d\nArea of Rectangle=%d\nArea of Circle=%.2f\nArea of Triangle=%d",
                          areaSquare, areaRectangle, areaCircle, areaTriangle);
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
    }
