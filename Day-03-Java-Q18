    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        double num1 = sc.nextDouble();
        double num2 = sc.nextDouble();
        double num3 = sc.nextDouble();
        
        if (num3 >= num1 && num3 >= num2) {
            System.out.println("Number3 is maximum with value of " + num3);
        }
        else if (num2 >= num1 && num2 >= num3) {
            System.out.println("Number2 is maximum with value of " + num2);

        else {
            System.out.println("Number1 is maximum with value of " + num1);
        }
        
        sc.close();
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
